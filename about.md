### Interests
When it comes to technology, I have found myself immersed in application development, computer architecture, and networking design. My technology journey all started with an introduction course to Java: where I tried my best to understand how Java works as a language, and how the Java compiler differs from other languages, such as C. I found it intriguing to study the differences between how the language interacts at the user interface, compiler, assembly, and machine level. I still find it amazing to this day how we've created such a usable system out of 0s and 1s. 

Through programming, I've gotten to create several projects of my own--all documented on this website. I am proud of every single one of them--while some of them were simplistic, they all contributed to my learning. I've found that implementation and experimentation is how I learn best, and the knowledge I've gained from these projects is invaluable. Furthermore, I'm excited about getting to document these projects, taking note of what technologies and processes I used in order to make it possible. While I am still growing as a technical documentation writer, I hope to get to the point where I successfully document all my previous projects thoroughly, alongside any future projects I work on! I think it is important to share knowledge with others, helping them understand how to use the technologies you have developed to improve their life in some way. I know for me, documentation has proved to be crucial in many projects of my own--I want to contribute to that. 

As I've continued taking courses in school, I learned about the various avenues in technology. While I've dabbled in software engineering and have had most experience in that field, I recently am starting to learn more about wireless networks. Through my coursework, I learned about how people stay connected through both IP and mobile networks. Once again, I find myself amazed at how far we've come--the Internet used to be a fickle concept, and now it is at the intersection of everyday life. I hope to learn more about these technologies and continue developing them to further stay connected. 

Another niche category I've really enjoyed in school is computer architecture. In my hardware class, I programmed with FPGAs and even created a processor from scratch. I'm amazed that such a simple concept--Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, Write--is at the core of every processor we use. While I did run into some complications with programming the superscalar processor, my partner in the class and I were successful in designing the single cycle and pipeline one. It was one of the proudest moments of my life--it took me months to build that system with my partner, and even though it was barely what the modern computer does, it felt good to create a little computer from zero code at all. In the future, I hope to be able to learn more about processors and possibly design one myself.

At the end of the day, I want to work for people. I feel most accomplished when I do the most for others, creating an impact with my work. I want to be part of a brighter future, creating new technology that will have a big impact on the world.

I also prioritize education. Learning has always been the backbone of my being--once I finish school, I hope to continue growing as a person in knowledge and experience. I'll continue to read more books and articles, build more projects of my own, and learn from others' experience to gain more knowledge of my own.

### Other Things
Besides technology, I like to dabble in music production. I started learning piano when I was five, guitar when I was ten, and drums at age twenty. Now that I can form my own one woman band, I like to play around on GarageBand and see what I can come up with. 

Reading has also been a big part of my life. When I got bored or upset as a child, I would escape reality through imaginary worlds. Now I read not only to experience different realities, I read to learn about others' experiences and/or scientific/psychological concepts. A new book on my shelf brings me great joy.

Recently I've also started to crochet & knit, making my own creations out of yarn. While I'm still a novice, I find it very theraputic to work with my needles whenever I'm stressed or anxious about upcoming events.
