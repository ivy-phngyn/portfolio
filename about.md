### Interests

While my interests are always evolving, my main focus right now is cybersecurity. Through both coursework and hands-on experience, I’ve come to understand just how crucial privacy and security are in today’s connected world. I find the process of breaking systems fun—there’s something incredibly rewarding about finding the perfect attack vector to exploit. I’m especially interested in low-level exploits and how attackers uncover and leverage vulnerabilities. Understanding how these attacks work deepens my appreciation for building stronger, more resilient systems.

I also prioritize education. Learning has always been the backbone of my being--even though I've finished school, I hope to continue growing as a person in knowledge and experience. I'll continue to read more books and articles, write more technical documentation and walk-throughs, and learn from others' experience to gain more knowledge of my own.

### More Technical Interests
My technology journey all started with an introduction course to Java: where I tried my best to understand how Java works as a language, and how the Java compiler differs from other languages, such as C. I found it intriguing to study the differences between how the language interacts at the user interface, compiler, assembly, and machine level. I still find it amazing to this day how we've created such a usable system out of 0s and 1s. 

A niche category I really enjoyed in school is computer architecture. In my hardware class, I programmed with FPGAs and even created a processor from scratch. I'm amazed that such a simple concept--Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, Write--is at the core of every processor we use. While I did run into some complications with programming the superscalar processor, my partner in the class and I were successful in designing the single cycle and pipeline one. It was one of the proudest moments of my life--it took me months to build that system with my partner, and even though it was barely what the modern computer does, it felt good to create a little computer from zero code at all. In the future, I hope to be able to learn more about processors and possibly design one myself.

### Other Things
I consider myself a musician at heart. You can find me trying to solo on the guitar to my favorite songs, or practicing Debussy and game OSTs on the piano.

Reading has also been a big part of my life. When I got bored or upset as a child, I would escape reality through imaginary worlds. Now I read not only to experience different realities, I read to learn about others' experiences and/or scientific/psychological concepts. A new book on my shelf brings me great joy.
