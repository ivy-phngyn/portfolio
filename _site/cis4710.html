<p>This was another very low level course. In this course, we used Verilog to program FPGAs to do specific applications.</p>

<p>Most of our homework was built on top of each other. First, we built a single cycle processor, where one instruction was executed in a single clock cycle. Then, we progressed to build a pipeline processor, where two instructions were simultaneously executed in a single clock cycle. Lastly, we built a superscalar processor, where we had two in-order pipelines running in parallel.</p>

<p>All of these projects, looking back, were very challenging. However, they were rewarding and definitely helped me learn more about how an actual computer works. I am amazed that people are able to build even more complex processors for real-world assembly languagesâ€“these very basic level homeworks took forever, and debugging was a process. The problem solving I had to do to complete these homeworks was fun, though, even if it was difficult coursework.</p>

<p>I am very glad to have taken this course, even though it was an elective. I learned a lot from it, and I still think about the class content today whenever I turn on my computer. Now I know what multi-threading is, and how useful parallelism is!</p>

<p>The homework assignments I completed for class (done with a partner) can be found <a href="https://github.com/ivyngu/cis471">here</a>.</p>
