<h1 class="post-title">Market & Social Systems on the Internet</h1>
<p>In this course, I learned about the OSI model, alongside graph theory. We also focused on web crawling and web scraping. 
For my final project, I got to come up with my own research question and answer it through a web scraping program.</p>

<p>The question I decided to research was: Does every Wikipedia article eventually lead back to the philosophy Wikipedia article?</p>

<p>To answer the question, I built a web scraper for Wikipedia articles using Rust. I also utilized BFS to see how many layers there were between an article and the Philosophy article. My findings can be found <a href="/assets/nets-final.pdf">here.</a> (Spoiler alert: The answer to my question is no.)</p>
