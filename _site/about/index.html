<h1 class="post-title">About</h1>
<h3 id="interests">Interests</h3>
<p>When it comes to technology, I have found myself immersed in application development, computer architecture, and networking design. My technology journey all started with an introduction course to Java: where I tried my best to understand how Java works as a language, and how the Java compiler differs from other languages, such as C. I found it intriguing to study the differences between how the language interacts at the user interface, compiler, assembly, and machine level. I still find it amazing to this day how we’ve created such a usable system out of 0s and 1s.</p>

<p>Through programming, I’ve gotten to create several projects of my own–all documented on this website. I am proud of every single one of them–while some of them were simplistic, they all contributed to my learning. I’ve found that implementation and experimentation is how I learn best, and the knowledge I’ve gained from these projects is invaluable.</p>

<p>As I’ve continued taking courses in school, I learned about the various avenues in technology. While I’ve dabbled in software engineering and have had most experience in that field, I recently am starting to learn more about wireless networks. Through my coursework, I learned about how people stay connected through both IP and mobile networks. Once again, I find myself amazed at how far we’ve come–the Internet used to be a fickle concept, and now it is at the intersection of everyday life. I hope to learn more about these technologies and continue developing them to further stay connected.</p>

<p>Another niche category I’ve really enjoyed in school is computer architecture. In my hardware class, I programmed with FPGAs and even created a processor from scratch. I’m amazed that such a simple concept–Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, Write–is at the core of every processor we use. While I did run into some complications with programming the superscalar processor, my partner in the class and I were successful in designing the single cycle and pipeline one. It was one of the proudest moments of my life–it took me months to build that system with my partner, and even though it was barely what the modern computer does, it felt good to create a little computer from zero code at all. In the future, I hope to be able to learn more about processors and possibly design one myself.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, I want to work for people. I feel most accomplished when I do the most for others, benefitting the public good. While it may be hard at times, my primary goal is to make the world a better place for the community around me with the knowledge and skills that I have.</p>

<p>I also prioritize education. Learning has always been the backbone of my being–once I finish school, I hope to continue growing as a person in knowledge and experience. I’ll continue to read more books and articles, build more projects of my own, and learn from others’ experience to gain more knowledge of my own.</p>

<h3 id="career-goals">Career Goals</h3>
<p>My experience has been all over the place when it comes to technology. The truth is, I’m still open to them. While I’ve truly enjoyed development projects, I would love to work on more networking related projects. The intersection between people and technology–IT–seems perfect for me, as I want to work with people while applying my expertise. Programming will always hold a special place in my heart though, as developing something from scratch is extraordinary. My main career goal is to grow: to develop skills in IT and contribute to the greater good.</p>

<h3 id="other-things">Other Things</h3>
<p>Besides technology, I like to dabble in music production. I started learning piano when I was five, guitar when I was ten, and drums at age twenty. Now that I can form my own one woman band, I like to play around on GarageBand and see what I can come up with.</p>

<p>Reading has also been a big part of my life. When I got bored or upset as a child, I would escape reality through imaginary worlds. Now I read not only to experience different realities, I read to learn about others’ experiences and/or scientific/psychological concepts. A new book on my shelf brings me great joy.</p>

<p>Recently I’ve also started to crochet &amp; knit, making my own creations out of yarn. While I’m still a novice, I find it very theraputic to work with my needles whenever I’m stressed or anxious about upcoming events.</p>
