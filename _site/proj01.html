<h1 class="post-title">Masters Nationals Scheduling Website</h1>
<p>I originally started working on this project partly as a favor, and partly as to further my own learning. It has taught me a lot about web development and database organization. I was lucky enough to have somewhat of a design partner to execute the project–they were in charge of making the website look pretty and usable, and I was in charge of functionality.</p>

<p>The technology stack we chose was done after expansive research as to what we wanted in the website, and what technologies could support those notions. Although starting the project was a bit daunting (I had never created a full on website before), I was prepared after a lot of documentation reading and video tutorials.</p>

<p>It was a lot of fun testing out new technologies with the website. Getting the website to function correctly at every step was very satisfying. While it’s still a work in progress, I hope it serves its purpose and helps out the crew team!</p>
