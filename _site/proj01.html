<h1 class="post-title">Masters Nationals Scheduling Website</h1>
<p>This project is still currently being worked on. The goal is to have this website replace a GoogleSheets organizer that allows a local rowing team to schedule their lineups for the annual Masters Nationals Regatta.</p>

<p>So far, the project has taught me a lot about web development and database organization. I was lucky enough to have a design partner to execute the project–they were in charge of making the website look pretty and usable, and I was in charge of functionality. Through this process, I have learned how to successfully collaborate with others and divide up tasks so that everyone has a role in the project. I’m also learning how to set deadlines, and meet client expectations with my work.</p>

<p>The technology stack we chose was done after expansive research as to what we wanted in the website, and what technologies could support those notions. Although starting the project was a bit daunting (I had never created a full on website before), I was prepared after a lot of documentation reading and video tutorials.</p>

<p>It was a lot of fun testing out new technologies with the website. Getting the website to function correctly at every step was very satisfying. While it’s still a work in progress, I hope it serves its purpose and helps out the crew team! Once the website is up, I will be sure to link it.</p>
