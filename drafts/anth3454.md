In this course, I learned basic statistical methods using SPSS. I was able to determine would kind of tests to perform on the data depending on the circumstances.
This included choosing between: 
- Hypothesis Testing
- Simple Linear Regression
- ANOVA

For my final project, I got to research my own question and choose a dataset to analyze and answer it. My paper can be found [here](assets/anth-prj.pdf).
