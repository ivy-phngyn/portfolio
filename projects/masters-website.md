title: Masters Nationals Scheduling Website
permalink: /proj01
---

This project is still currently being worked on. The goal is to have this website replace a GoogleSheets organizer that allows a local rowing team to schedule their lineups for the annual Masters Nationals Regatta. 

So far, the project has taught me a lot about web development and database organization. I was lucky enough to have a design partner to execute the project--they were in charge of making the website look pretty and usable, and I was in charge of functionality.

The technology stack we chose was done after expansive research as to what we wanted in the website, and what technologies could support those notions. Although starting the project was a bit daunting (I had never created a full on website before), I was prepared after a lot of documentation reading and video tutorials. 

It was a lot of fun testing out new technologies with the website. Getting the website to function correctly at every step was very satisfying. While it's still a work in progress, I hope it serves its purpose and helps out the crew team!
