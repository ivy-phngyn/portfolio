title: Pipeline Processor

My partner and I built a single cycle processor, where one instruction was executed in a single clock cycle. Then, we progressed to build a pipeline processor, where two instructions were simultaneously executed in a single clock cycle. Lastly, we built a superscalar processor, where we had two in-order pipelines running in parallel.
