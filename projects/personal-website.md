This personal website, that you are now browsing, uses Jekyll. Since most of the website contains markdown content and is static, I decided it would be best to use a static site generator that supports markdown conversion to HTML. So far, it works really well and I'm pleased with the results!

I based my website design off of another Jekyll theme I saw, linked down below. I was able to learn how to develop my own static site using Jekyll by observing other theme structures and reading documentation on the process. 

Design based off of:
- [Moonwalk](https://github.com/abhinavs/moonwalk)
- [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima)
- [Color Palette](https://colorhunt.co/palette/163020304d30b6c4b6eef0e5)

Resources I Used:
- [Jekyll Docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)
- [How to use URLs & Links in Jekyll](https://mademistakes.com/mastering-jekyll/how-to-link/)
