title: OOP Java Games

Using object oriented programming, I developed two games in Java:
- [Brickbreaker](https://github.com/ivy-phngyn/brickbreaker)
- [Checkers](https://github.com/ivy-phngyn/checkers)

It was really fun to plan out the various classes for the games in order to keep it modular. 
The fact that I was able to play the games afterwards with other people was great!
