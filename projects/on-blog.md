My grandfather has been writing for a very long time. His works include recollections of family trips and his life in Vietnam. I've always wanted to share his works with the world, because I believe he deserves recognition for the dedication he puts into his writing. Through creating this blog, I wanted to give him a medium to share his story. 

While there's much more writing to upload, I started with his most recent works. You can find the blog here: phancthanh.com

Design based off of:
- [Devise](https://github.com/austingebauer/devise): I modified it a little for the Vietnamese audience.

Resources I Used:
- [Hugo Docs](https://gohugo.io/documentation/)
- [Youtube Tutorial](https://youtu.be/LIFvgrRxdt4?si=hbuQ24C4G4eZAP9J): I really liked the methodology of separating repositories for the website static content vs the code.
