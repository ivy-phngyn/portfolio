In this course, I got to learn all about databases. While the majority of the course was spent discussing relational databases such as SQL,
we also spent some time exploring NoSQL databases as well.

My favorite thing about this course was getting to create and populate my very own database via AWS, then using it to populate a website.
I worked in a team of four to accomplish such a feat, and it was very good hands-on experience.
I also have a good understanding of how to design and optimize a database as well now, which is a great skill to have to ensure
good database performance!
