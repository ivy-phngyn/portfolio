I thoroughly enjoyed this course. It was such a fun experience, albeit difficult at times. The various theories I learned about in regards to network
security were very relevant to today's technology, and shed light on how easily data can be compromised. 
My favorite part of the course was getting to tinker and break programs. It was so fun getting to investigate the computer at a low level to try to
cause bugs to happen. While these bugs were only possible in a controlled environment, I just loved exploring and learning through hands-on hacker experience.
I learned a lot from this course that I will continue to use in the future.
