Through my introduction programming classes, I learned about data structures and algorithms. I specifically used Java (and a little bit of OCaml) within these courses. 
Through homework assignments, I practiced these concepts through implementation.

Some notable homework assignments were:
- Creating a Paint program, almost like Microsoft Paint, using OCaml.
- Chat server backend development with Java.
- Using a Markov Chain to create a Twitter Bot.
- Developing a Caesarian Cipher.
- Building a Binary Min Heap to use in Huffman Coding.
- Graph algorithm homework, such as a Maze Solver & Widest Path using BFS & MSTs.

End of Semester Projects Completed:
- [Brickbreaker](https://github.com/ivy-phngyn/brickbreaker)
