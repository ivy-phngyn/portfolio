In this course, I learned about the OSI model, alongside graph theory. We also focused on web crawling and web scraping. 
For my final project, I got to come up with my own research question and answer it through a web scraping program.

The question I decided to research was: Does every Wikipedia article eventually lead back to the philosophy Wikipedia article? 

To answer the question, I built a web scraper for Wikipedia articles using Rust. I also utilized BFS to see how many layers there were between an article and the Philosophy article. My findings can be found [here.](/assets/nets-final.pdf) (Spoiler alert: The answer to my question is no.)
